This project is a simple solar system animation created using the p5.js library. It visualizes the orbits and rotations of celestial bodies, including the sun, earth, and moons.

## Features

- **Sun:** The central object that spins around its axis.
- **Earth:** Orbits around the sun, rotates around its axis, and has a moon in orbit.
- **Moon:** Orbits around the earth, and hidden within its dark side, there's a mysterious asteroid or spaceship.
- **Second Moon:** A smaller moon orbiting the earth.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add more celestial bodies, change colors, or experiment with different animations. The code is well-commented, making it easy to understand and customize.
